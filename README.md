### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently on my way to becoming a web developer. <br>
My big goal is to be able to translate the creative ideas in my head into technical reality.<br>
That's why I'm continuously developing and learning something new every day. Running into mistakes and finding solutions is a great experience.<br> 
<br>
Take a look at my journey, from the first HTML/css projects to my current react project "**Green Thumb ðŸŒ±**".<br><br>
