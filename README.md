### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently on my way to becoming a web developer. 
My big goal is to be able to translate the creative ideas in my head into technical reality.
That's why I'm continuously developing and learning something new every day. Running into mistakes and finding solutions is a great experience. 

Take a look at my journey, from the first HTML/CSS projects to my current react project "Green Thumb ðŸŒ±".<br>
